== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I create product variants based on combinations of their attribute values for VirtueMart? =
Cart2Cart provides an opportunity to create product variants based on the combinations of their attribute values, which can be chosen as an additional option. Service will migrate attribute combinations as child (item) products based on size, colour, material, quality, memory, etc. Currently this option is available only for VirtueMart 1.x versions.

Our script distinguishes Joomla users and VirtueMart users. You can transfer customers of your VirtueMart store as a basic option and choose Joomla users migration - as additional. Because of CMS peculiarities, users from Joomla will be displayed as customers on your target store.

= Will the orders history be fully migrated for customer/administrator consultation? =
Sure, all previous orders will be migrated. You have to take into a consideration that all orders will have current status, as it isn't possible to transfer order status history.

= I have a question regarding SEO. I am planning to use Cart2Cart to migrate my Virtuemart store to WooCommerce. How is the SEO part handled in Wordpress once you migrated all the products? =
Each shopping cart uses its own way to build URLs for pages (products/categories). Unfortunately, it's too complicated to migrate the URL in general. Cart2Cart service does not support migration of the URL structure.

= Can I try your service before setting up paid migration? =
Yes, we provide FREE Demo Migration service that you can use before starting full migration.
You should create an account and setup the source and target carts. You will be able to check the results of a limited number of entities (up to 10 products/customers/orders). Approximate time of Demo Migration is 10-30 minutes.
You can make any changes you need and run DEMO migration again. After you are satisfied with results you can run the live migration.
